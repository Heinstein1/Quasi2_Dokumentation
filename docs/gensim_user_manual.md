# GenSim - General Information
## 1.  What is GenSim?

GenSim - for "generic building simulation" - is a building simulation software using the *EnergyPlus速* simulation computing core to generate high-resolution heating and cooling demand profiles as well as electricity demand profiles. "Generic" in this context means "generally valid" building model. This means that the software can be used to model and simulate any type of building in a very flexible and simplified way. 
The software was developed for use in the context of project pre-planning where usually no large time budget is available for detailed simulations of buildings. A detailed input and simulation of buildings with common applications like DesignBuilder速, IDA ICE速 or TRNSYS速 is usually time consuming. GenSim was therefore developed with the aim of ensuring the fastest and simplest possible simulation of buildings. In early planning phases often only relatively rough data on the planned buildings are available. Therefore, an optimal relationship between the level of detail of the model and the accuracy of the input parameters should be achieved. 

### Recent Publication

We recently published a scientific paper in the journal "Energies" with a detailed description of the software architecture and capabilities of GenSim. To validate GenSim, we also performed a comparison of simulation results from GenSim, DesignBuilder and measurement data of two years, which is documented in the article. The paper is published with open access at:
