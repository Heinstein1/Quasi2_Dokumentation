# Transient effects

## Reduction of usable heat during start-up of each component
The reduction of the usable heat output during start-up of a system can be described using either linear oder exponential start-up and cool-down ramps. Both are described in the following.

### Linear transient effects
The following figure illustrate a linear start-up and cool-down behaviour characerized by the start-up time (SUT) and cool-down time (CDT) the system needs to reach full thermal energy output or to cool down completely.

![Heat reduction during start-up](fig/221028_Start-up-Reduction_general.svg)

The current thermal power output can be expressed with the following sectionally defined function. The simulation engine tracks the time an energy system is running or not running. The on-time \(t_{on}\) represents the time since the last start-up of the energy system while \(t_{off}\) is the time since the last shut-down. To handle the case when the energy system has not cooled down completely since the last shut-down, the linear start-up curve can be shifted using \(t_{shift}\) to represent a warm start:

$$
 \dot{Q}_{out,current}(t_{on})  = \dot{Q}_{stationary} 
\begin{cases}
 \frac{t_{on}+t_{shift}}{\text{SUT}} & \text{ for } t_{on}+t_{shift} \ < \text{SUT} \\
1 & \text{ for } t_{on}+t_{shift} \ \geq  \text{SUT}
\end{cases} 
$$

The required timeshift \(t_{shift}\) of the warming-up curve can be calculated within the timestep where the energy system is turned on again using the cooling-down curve and the time since the last shut-down:

$$
\dot{Q}_{out,current}(t_{off}) = \text{max} \left ( \dot{Q}_{out,current}(t_{on}) \left ( 1-\frac{t_{off}}{\text{CDT}} \right ),0 \right ) 
$$
that leads with \(\dot{Q}_{out,current}(t_{on}=0) = \dot{Q}_{out,current}(t_{off})\) to 
$$
t_{shift} = \text{max} \left ( \frac{\dot{Q}_{out,current}(t_{on})}{\dot{Q}_{stationary} } \left( \text{SUT} - t_{off} \frac{\text{SUT}}{\text{CDT}} \right ), 0 \right )
$$

With this information, the average thermal power output in the current timestep between \(t_{on,lower}\) and \(t_{on,upper}\) can be calculated using the integral of the sectionally defined function above:

$$
 \dot{Q}_{out} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{stationary}}{t_{on,upper}-t_{on,lower}}
\begin{cases}
 \frac{t_{shift} \ (t_{on,upper}-t_{on,lower}) + \frac{1}{2} \ (t_{on,upper}^2-t_{on,lower}^2)}{\text{SUT}} & \text{ for } t_{on}+t_{shift} \ < \text{SUT} \\
t_{on,upper}-t_{on,lower} & \text{ for } t_{on}+t_{shift} \ \geq  \text{SUT}
\end{cases} 
$$

This integral results in the following yellow curve taht represents the normalized average thermal power output with \(t_{on,lower} = 0\):

Note that \(t_{shift}\) has to be set to zero at the first timestep of the simulation and \(t_{on,lower}\) and \(t_{on,upper}\) have to start couting again at every change of operation (on/off, not part-load).

### Exponencial transient effects
While the method above describes a linear thermal power output during the heat-up of an energy system that requires the integration of sectionally defined functions, the calculation of the time-step averaged thermal power can be also performed using continious exponential functions. This is described for excample in the TRNSYSType 401[^Wetter1996]. The time span for each energy system to heat up is defined by the constant heat-up-time \(\tau_{on}\) and the cool-down time \(\tau_{off}\). This is not the same time span as defined above (SUT and CDT) for the linear warm-up! The following figure shows an exemplary operation curve, analogous to the one for linear transient effects above. An energy system is started from a cool basis, heated up to nominal thermal power output, then shut down and restarted before the system has cooled down completely.

![transient shut-down and tun-on effects exponential](fig/220223_transient_on_off.JPG)

The calculation of the reduced heat output due to transient effects at current time \(t_{on}\) since the last start of the energy system and with the constant heat-up-time \(\tau_{on}\) of each energy system can be calculated with the following expression:
$$
\dot{Q}_{out,current}(t_{on}) = \dot{Q}_{stationary} \left (1 - e^{-\frac{t_{on}}{\tau_{on}}} \right )
$$

If the system has not been cooled town completely since the last shut-down, the heat-up losses can be calculated using the following equation with \(t_{shift}\) representing the time shift for the exponential function (compare to figure above).
$$
\dot{Q}_{out,current}(t_{on}) = \dot{Q}_{stationary} \left (1 - e^{-\frac{t_{shift} + t_{on}}{\tau_{on}}} \right )
\ \ \text{  with  } \ \ t_{shift} = - \tau_{on} \ ln \left ( 1-\frac{\dot{Q}_{out,current}(t_{off})}{\dot{Q}_{stationary}} \right )
$$

The cool-down curve is calculated analogously in order to get the current state of the system in the case of restart in the next time step.
$$
\dot{Q}_{out,current}(t_{off}) = \dot{Q}_{stationary} \left (e^{-\frac{t_{shift}+t_{off}}{\tau_{off}}} \right ) \ \ \text{  with  } \ \ t_{shift} = - \tau_{off} \ ln \left ( 1-\frac{\dot{Q}_{out,current}(t_{on})}{\dot{Q}_{stationary}} \right )
$$

To get the average thermal energy output within the current timestep between \(t_{on,lower}\) and \(t_{on,upper}\), an integration of the exponential function is needed. According to the TRNSYS Type 401[^Wetter1996], this leads to

$$
\dot{Q}_{out} = \dot{Q}_{stationary} \left ( 1 + \frac{\tau_{on}}{t_{on,upper}-t_{on,lower}} \ e^{-\frac{t_{shift}}{\tau_{on}}} \ \left ( e^{-\frac{t_{on,upper}}{\tau_{on}}} - e^{-\frac{t_{on,lower}}{\tau_{on}}} \right )   \right )
$$
