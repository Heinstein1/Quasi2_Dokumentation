# Exemplary energy system models

In this section some exemplary energy system models in ReSiE are described and their simulation results are discussed. This may help to understand the capabilities, limitations and the specific usage of ReSiE. This page gives an overview over the various examples, which are described in more detail on corresponding sub-pages.

## Comparing a complex energy system between ReSiE and oemof

Described in detail [here](resie_examples/comparison_oemof/index.md).

A complex energy system including technologies such as a hydrogen electrolyser, seasonal thermal energy storage, multiple heat pumps and multiple short-term thermal energy storages, is modelled in ReSiE and results are compared to the results of the same energy system modelled and simulated in the [simulation framework oemof](https://www.oemof.org). As both tools differ in some aspects, the differences are discussed and it is shown why and when one might use one tool over the other.
