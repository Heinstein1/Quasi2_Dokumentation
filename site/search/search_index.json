Their general system chart with the denotation of the in- and outputs is shown in the figure below. The energy balance at the heat pump is built up from the incoming electricity P_{el,HP} , the incoming heat at a low temperature level T_{HP,source,in} and the outgoing heat flow at a higher temperature level T_{HP,sink,out} . The energy balance of the heat pump model is shown in the following figure: The efficiency of the heat pump is defined by the coefficient of performance (COP). The COP determines the electrical power P_{el,HP} required to raise the temperature of a mass flow from the lower temperature level T_{HP,source,in} to T_{HP,sink,out} : COP_{HP} = \\frac{\\dot{Q}_{HP,out}}{P_{el,HP}} \\quad \\leq \\quad COP_{Carnot} = \\frac{T_{HP,sink,out}[K]}{T_{HP,sink,out}-T_{HP,source,in} } COP_{HP} = \\eta_{Carnot} \\ COP_{Carnot} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad 0 \\leq \\eta_{Carnot} \\leq 1 The COP is always smaller than the maximum possible Carnot coefficient of performance ( COP_{Carnot} ), which is calculated from the condenser outlet and evaporator inlet temperature. The maximum possible COP calculated by Carnot is reduced by the carnot effiency factor \\eta_{Carnot} , which is according to [Arpagaus2018] 2 around 45 % for high temperature heat pumps and around 40 % for conventional heat pumps. The energy balance (or power balance) of the heat pump can be drawn up on the basis of the latter figure and on the ratio between supplied and dissipated heat power, expressed as the COP: \\dot{Q}_{HP,out} = \\frac{COP_{HP}}{COP_{HP} -1} \\ \\dot{Q}_{HP,in} \\mathrm{\\quad with \\quad} \\dot{Q}_{HP,out} = \\dot{Q}_{HP,in} + P_{HP,el} The power of the heat pump's electric supply, including the losses of the power electronics, is given as: P_{el,HP,Bezug} = \\frac{P_{el,HP}}{\\eta_{HP,LE}} Since the temperatures of the heat flows entering and leaving the heat pump, which have not been considered so far, may also be relevant for connected energy systems, the heat outputs can be calculated on the basis of the respective mass flow \\dot{m} and the physical properties of the heat transfer medium (specific heat capacity c_{p} and, if applicable, the density \\rho ) by rearranging the following equation: \\dot{Q} = \\dot{m} \\ c_{p} \\ (T_{max} - T_{min}) Modelling approaches for HP: Overview According to [Blervaque2015] 1 , four different categories are described in the literature when it comes to the simulation of heat pumps: quasi-static empirical models : equation-fit models based on discretised manufacturer or certification data fitted to polynomes, used for example in EnergyPlus or TRNSYS dynamic empirical models : equasion-fit models extended by continious transient effects detailed physical models : thermodynamic approach based on dynamic and refrigerant flow modelling, many parameters required simplified physical models or parameter-estimation models: based on physical model, but with less input parameter needed due to internal assumptions For the simulation of energy systems in an early design phase, for which Quasi is intended, only quasi-static or dynamic empirical models can be considered due to the lack of detailed information about the technical components used and the computational effort required for physical models. Therefore, an empirical model based on manufacturer data or certification process data is implemented in Quasi. There are several aspects to be considered when simulating a heat pump based on equation-fitting, which will be briefly described in the following: The COP of a heat pump, representing the efficiency in a current time step, depends highly on the temperature of the source and the requested temperature of the heat demand. Generally speaking, the efficiency and thus the COP decreases with larger temperature differences between source and sink. Additionaly, the maximum thermal power of the heat pump is not constant for different operation temperatures. The available thermal power is decreasing with lower source temperature, an effect that mainly occurs in heat pumps with air as the source medium. The rated power given for a specific heat pump is only valid for a specified combination of sink and source temperature. The specification for the declaration of the rated power is described in DIN EN 14511 3 . Furthermore, the efficiency and therefor the COP is changing in part load operation. In the past, mostly on-off heat pump where used, regulating the total power output in a given time span by alternating the current state beween on and off. This causes efficency losses mostly due to thermal capacity effects and initial compression power needed at each start. (ToDo: Socal2021) In the last years, modulating heat pumps are more common, using a frequency inverter to adjust the speed of the compression motor and therefor affecting the power output. Interestingly, this method leads to an efficiency increase in part load operation with a peak in efficiency at around 30 to 60 % of the nominal power output. In the literature, many research groups have investigated this effect, compare for excample to Bettanini2003 4 , Toffanin2019 5 , Torregrosa-Jaime2008 6 , Fuentes2019 7 , Blervaque2015 1 or Fahlen2012 8 . For a most realistic representation, all three discussed effects need to be considered - temperature-dependent COP, temperature-dependent power and part-load-dependent COP. The calulation of these dependencies will be described below. Modelling approaches for HP: Detail Temperature-dependent COP The temperature-dependend COP can be calculated from different methods: using the COP_{Carnot} with the carnot effiency factor \\eta_{Carnot} as explained above (easy, simple and fast, but unreal high efficiency with small temperature differences of source and sink) looking up the COP in a look-up table in dependence of the condenser outlet and the evaporator inlet temperature (for computational efficienc, lookup-tables are fitted to polynomes in pre-processing) COP calculated as fraction of temperature-dependend electrical and thermal power, gained from generally developed polynomes. Here, the temperature-depended variation of the maximal power output of the heat pump can be directly taken into account. As example for a lookup-table COP (second bulletpoint above), the following figure from Steinacker2022 15 shows a map of a high-temperature heat pump as a set of curves, depending on the evaporator inlet and condenser outlet temperature. In three dimensions, this figure would result in a surface that can be parameterized with a three-dimensional spline interpolation algorithm. ToDO: translate to english Maximum thermal and electrical power In order to adress a change in maximum power output or input of the heat pump at different operating temperatures, two different approaches can be used. The more complex but also more accurate approache is the use of polynomial fits of temperature-dependend thermal and electrical power. These polynomes depend on the condenser outlet and the evaporator inlet temperature and they need to be calculated from manufacturer data or from measurements. In order to adress the early planning stage, general, market-averaged polynomes need to be created, representing an average heat pump. Aditionally, one specific heat pump model can be used if the the required data is available. ToDo : Add method of calculating market-averaged polynomes! Biquadratic polynomes according to TRNSYS Type 401 \\dot{Q}_{HP,max} = c_{q1} + c_{q2} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,source,in} + c_{q3} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,sink,out} + c_{q4} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,source,in} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,sink,out} + \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot \\\\ \\ c_{q5} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,source,in}^2 + c_{q6} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,sink,out}^2 \\dot{P}_{el,HP,max} = c_{p1} + c_{p2} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,source,in} + c_{p3} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,sink,out} + c_{p4} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,source,in} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,sink,out} + \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot \\\\ \\ c_{p5} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,source,in}^2 + c_{p6} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,sink,out}^2 where all temeratures have to be normed according to \\bar{T} = \\frac{T \\ [\u00b0C]}{273.15} + 1 The second method to adjust the electrical and thermal energy would be a linear gradient that adjust the rated power in dependency of one temperature. Checking the available data of many different heat pumps from Stiebel-Eltron 9 , a simplified correlation can be observed: the thermal power is dependend on the source temperature, but independent on the sink temperature (the lower the source temperature the lower is the heating power) the electrical power is dependend on the sink temperature, but independent on the source temperature (the higher the sink temperature the higher is the electrical power consumption) This gives the possibility to linearly adjust the available thermal power with the change of the source temperature and the electrical power demand with the change of the temperature of the sink. Which power needs to be adjusted depends on the choice of the control strategy - thermally or electrically controlled. The gradient of the power de- or increase with changing temperature needs to be specified. Part load efficiency The COP of the modeled heat pump depends not only on the temperatures of the sink and the source but also on the current part load ratio (PLR). The relation of the COP and the PLR is assumed to be non-linear. The COP can be corrected using a non-linear part load factor (PLF) in dependence of the PLR. Part load ratio (PLR) = power (el. or th.) demand or availability in current time step in relation to maximum power (el. or th.) with current temperatures: PLR = \\frac{current \\ power}{max. \\ power} Part load facor (PLF) = adjustment factor for COP at different PLR: COP_{part-load} = COP_{full-load} * PLF It follows from the definition of the COP that the correlation between the electrical power consumption and the heat output of the heat pump in part load operation is therefore not linear too. For simplification, the heat output of the heat pump itself is assumed to linear in part load operation between \\dot{Q}_{HP,min} at PL_{HP,min} and \\dot{Q}_{HP,max} at 100% compressor speed as shown in the figure below. The coefficient of performance in partial load operation is approximated using a correction function. The literature provides different examples for the quadratic part-load behaviour of the COP (see section \"Overview\" for literature examples). As an example, the part-load-dependend COP of an ENRGI-Heatpump is shown in the following figure (Source: Enrgi 10 ) The part-load behaviour depends also on the type of the heat pump (on-off or inverter heat pump), as shown for example in Bettanini2003 4 or in Socal2021 11 . For illustration, the following figure is taken from the latter reference to demonstrate the different part load factors of the COP (y-axis) at different part load ratios for different heat pump technologies: Taking the correction factor curve from the figure above for inverter heat pumps, the maximum part load factor is reached at 50 % part load with an increase of the COP of 1.1. Contrary, in Toffanin2019 5 , the part load factor is assumed to be much higher, reaching its maximum at 25 % part load ratio with a part load factor of 2.1. These discrepancies illustrate the wide range of literature data and the difficulty in finding a general part load curve. The figure above shows also the difference of the part load factor comparing on-off and inverter heat pumps as well as the defined on-off losses in DIN EN 14825 for the calculation of the seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP). ToDo: Description of method of PLF-Factor curcve in Quasi II: Using Blervaque2015? Steps to perform in the simulation model of the heat pump The calculation is based on TRNSYS Type 401 12 that is similar to Type 204 13 . The cycling losses of the heat pump in both TRNSYS models are calculated using an exponential function to describe the thermal capacity effecs during heat-up and cool-down. Here, these cycling losses will only be used during start and stop of the heat pump - actual cycling losses from on-off heatpumps will be considered separately in the process to allow the consideration of modulating heat pumps as well. Steps to calculate the electrical and thermal energy in- and outputs of HP: using polynomial fits to calculate stationary thermal and electrical full-load power at given temperatures of T_{HP,sink,out} and T_{HP,source,in} for given nominal thermal power differing source and sink medium: air-water water-water sole-water differing temperature range: normale heat pump high-temperature heat pump polynomial fits have to be normalized to rated power at specified temperatures! Rated power has to be related always to the same temperature lift according to DIN EN 14511 --> different fits for normal (B10/W35, W10/W35, A10/W35) and high temperture (B35/W85, W35/W85) heat pumps reduce thermal power output due to transient capacity effects during start-up as average over current time step calculate COP at full load with calculated thermal and electrical power get demand of thermal or electrical energy differing if thermal or electric energy related operation strategy is chosen calculate part load ratio (PLR) with current demand and temperature-dependend full-load power get part load factor (PLF) from coeffcicient curve using the PLR to adjust full-load COP differing: modulating (intverter) or on-off heat pump calculate part-load COP using full-load COP and PLF may adjust part-load COP by icing losses (air-water, air-air) calculate the unknown power (either electrical or thermal) with adjusted part-load COP and known power Contraty to the TRNSYS Type 401, the mass flow here is variable and not constant within two timesteps, therefore the T_{HP,sink,out} and \\dot{Q}_{HP,sink,out} can be calculated directly without the need of iteration as implemented in Type 401. Here, the T_{HP,sink,out} is a fixed, user-specified value in the presented simplified model. The polynomes describing the temperature-depended thermal and electrical power of the heat pump need to be normalized to the power consumption at the rated operation point. Therefore, the following steps are necessary: fit data to polynome for thermal and electrical energy calculate power at specified nominal temperatures with generated fitted polynome normalize polynome to calculated rated power at specific temperature using a fraction_factor If universal data table or the Carnot-COP reduced by an efficiency factor should be used instead of the more accurate model described above, a different calculation approach is needed: Get power at current temperatures using nominal power without a temperature-dependency or using polynomial fits to calculate stationary thermal or electrical full-load power at given temperatures of T_{HP,sink,out} and T_{HP,source,in} , depending on control strategy (see above) get stationary full-load COP at given temperatures of T_{HP,sink,out} and T_{HP,source,in} either from COP data table (fitted to polynome in pre-calculation) or Carnot-COP reduced by an efficiency factor determine the unknown, non-controlled full load power (electrial or thermal) with known, controlled power and COP get demand of controlled energy (thermal or electrical) differing if thermal or electric energy related operation strategy is chosen calculate part load ratio (PLR) with current demand and temperature-dependend full-load power get part load factor (PLF) from coeffcicient curve using the PLR to adjust full-load COP differing: modulating (intverter) or on-off heat pump calculate part-load COP using full-load COP and PLF may adjust part-load COP by icing losses (air-water, air-air) calculate the non-controlled (either electrical or thermal) power with adjusted part-load COP and the controlled power Inputs und Outputs of the Heat Pump: Symbol Description Unit \\dot{Q}_{HP,in} heat flow supplied to the HP (heat source) [MW] \\dot{Q}_{HP,out} heat flow leaving the HP (heat sink) [MW] P_{el,HP} electric power demand of the HP [MW] P_{el,HP,supply} electric power demand of the HP incl. losses of the power electronics [MW] T_{HP,sink,in} condenser inlet temperature [\u00b0C] T_{HP,sink,out} condenser outlet temperature [\u00b0C] T_{HP,source,in} evaporator inlet temperature [\u00b0C] T_{HP,source,out} evaporator outlet temperature [\u00b0C] Parameter of the Heat Pump: ToDO Symbol Description Unit \\dot{Q}_{HP,max} maximum thermal power of the heat pump [MW] \\dot{Q}_{HP,min} minimum thermal power of the heat pump at PL_{HP,min} [MW] PL_{HP,min} minimum possible part load of the heat pump [%] COP_{HP}(T_{HP,sink,out}, T_{HP,source,in}, x_{HP}) coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump incl. thermal losses depending on T_{HP,sink,out} and T_{HP,source,in} and on current state x_{HP} [-] \\eta_{HP,PE} efficiency of power electronics of heat pump [-] \\eta_{Carnot} efficiency factor of heat pump, reduces the Carnot-COP [-] MOT_{HP} minimum operating time of heat pump [min] SUP_{HP} start-up time of the HP until full heat supply (linear curve) [min] State Variables of Heat Pump: Symbol Description Unit x_{HP} current operating state (on, off, part load) [%] Electrolyser The electrolyzer uses electrical energy to split water into its components hydrogen ( H_2 ) and oxygen ( O_2 ) as shown in the following reaction equation: 2 \\ H_2O \\rightarrow 2 \\ H_2 + O_2 If the electrical energy is provided by renewable energies, the resulting hydrogen is labeled as \"green hydrogen\" and can be used to decarbonize the mobility or industrial sector or fed into the natural gas grid. The waste heat generated in the process can be used directly by feeding it into a heat network or via an intermediate heat pump. For flexible operation, it is possible to discharge the waste heat to the environment using a chiller. The use of waste heat is an important factor for the overall efficiency of the electrolyzer. The general energy and mass flow in the electrolyser as well as the losses considered in the model can be seen in the following figure. Fig. 5: Energy and mass flows in the electrolyser The relationship between supplied hydrogen of the electrolysis (energy ( \\dot{E}_{Ely,H_2} ) or mass flow ( \\dot{m}_{Ely,H_2} )) and the consumption of electrical energy ( P_{el,Ely} ) is given in the following equation, where e_{H_2} can be either the net or the gross calorific value of the hydrogen: \\begin{align} \\dot{E}_{Ely,H_2}= P_{el,Ely} \\enspace \\eta_{Ely,H_2} \\end{align} \\begin{equation} \\dot{m}_{Ely,H_2} = \\frac{\\dot{E}_{Ely,H_2}}{e_{H_2}} \\end{equation} Due to the purification losses of the hydrogen caused by the reduction of oxygen molecules contained in the hydrogen gas in the catalyst, depending on the electrolysis technology, the actually obtained hydrogen energy or mass flow is reduced by the proportion of the hydrogen losses \\eta_{H_2 \\ purification} to the energy or mass flows, supplemented with index out : \\dot{E}_{Ely,H_2,out}= (1-\\eta_{H_2 \\ purification}) \\ \\dot{E}_{Ely,H_2} \\dot{m}_{Ely,H_2,out} = (1-\\eta_{H_2 \\ purification}) \\ \\dot{m}_{Ely,H_2} Conversely, by rearranging and substituting the previous equations from a required hydrogen mass flow, the electrical power consumption can be calculated as follows: P_{el,Ely} = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{Ely,H_2,out} \\ e_{H_2}}{\\eta_{Ely,H_2} \\ (1 - \\eta_{H_2 \\ purification})} The usable waste heat from the electrolysis process \\dot{Q}_{Ely,waste heat} is determined, depending on the available information, as \\dot{Q}_{Ely,waste heat} = \\eta_{Ely,heat} \\enspace (1-\\eta_{Ely,H_2}) \\enspace P_{el,Ely} = \\frac{(1 - \\eta_{Ely,H_2}) \\ \\eta_{Ely,heat} } { (1 - \\eta_{H_2 \\ purification}) \\ \\eta_{Ely,H_2} } \\ \\dot{E}_{Ely,H_2,out} With a known mass flow \\dot{m}_{HP,cool} and the specific heat capacity of the heat transfer medium of the heat recovery c_{p,cool} as well as a known inlet temperature T_{Ely,cool,in} , the outlet temperature of the heat transfer medium from the cooling circuit T_{Ely,cool,out} can be determined by rearranging the following equation: \\dot{Q}_{Ely,waste heat} = \\dot{m}_{HP,cool} \\enspace c_{p,cool} \\enspace (T_{Ely,hot,out} - T_{Ely,cool,in}) The heat loss \\dot{Q}_{Ely,loss} , which cannot be used and is dissipated to the environment via heat transport mechanisms, is calculated as follows \\dot{Q}_{Ely,loss} = P_{el,Ely} - \\dot{Q}_{Ely,waste heat} - \\dot{E}_{Ely,H_2} \\\\ = P_{el,Ely} \\ (1 - \\eta_{Ely,heat} + \\eta_{Ely,heat} \\ \\eta_{Ely,H_2} - \\eta_{Ely,H_2}) The actual needed power supply of the electrolyzer P_{el,Ely,supply} increases by losses in the power electronics and results from the electrical reference power P_{el,Ely} and the losses in the power electronics \\eta_{Ely,PE} to P_{el,Ely,supply} = \\frac{P_{el,Ely}}{\\eta_{Ely,PE}} Since the oxygen produced during the electrolysis process can also be utilized economically under certain circumstances, the resulting oxygen mass flow \\dot{m}_{Ely,O_2,out} is determined from the stoichiometric ratio of the reaction equation of the water splitting described at the beginning: \\dot{m}_{Ely,O_2,out} = v_{O_2,H_2} \\enspace \\dot{m}_{Ely,H_2} \\text{with} \\quad v_{O_2,H_2} = \\frac{atomic \\ mass \\ O_2}{atomic \\ mass \\ 2 \\ H_2} = \\frac{2 * 15,9990 \\ u}{2*2*1,0008 \\ u} = 7,9386 The required mass flow of water \\dot{m}_{Ely,H_2O,in} can be determined from the supplied masses of hydrogen and oxygen and the purification losses in the water treatment unit, characterized by the fraction of purification losses \\eta_{H_2O \\ treatment} . \\dot{m}_{Ely,H_2O,in} = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{Ely,H_2} + \\dot{m}_{Ely,O_2,out}}{1- \\eta_{H_2O \\ treatment}} Assumption: The electrolyzer is only operated between minimum 0 % and maximum 100 % load.

Short-term thermal energy storage (STTES) The short-term energy storage is a simplified model without thermal losses to the ambient. It consists of two adiabatically separated temperature layers, represented as an ideally layered storage without any interaction between the two layers. This model was chosen to keep the computational effort as small as possible. If a more complex model is needed, the seasonal thermal energy storage can be used that is including energy and exergetic losses. The rated thermal energy content Q_{STTES,rated} of the STTES can be calculated using the volume V_{STTES} , the density \\rho_{STTES} , the specific thermal capacity of the medium in the storage cp_{STTES} and the temperature span within the STTES: Q_{STTES,rated} = V_{STTES} \\ \\rho_{STTES} \\ cp_{STTES} \\ (T_{STTES,hot} - T_{STTES,cold}) The amount of the total input ( Q_{STTES,in,t} ) and output energy ( Q_{STTES,out,t} ) in every timestep is defined as Q_{STTES,in,t} = \\dot{Q}_{STTES,in,t} \\ \\Delta t = \\dot{m}_{STTES,in} \\ cp_{STTES} \\ (T_{STTES,hot} - T_{STTES,cold}) \\ \\Delta t and Q_{STTES,out,t} = \\dot{Q}_{STTES,out,t} \\ \\Delta t = \\dot{m}_{STTES,out} \\ cp_{STTES} \\ (T_{STTES,hot} - T_{STTES,cold}) \\ \\Delta t. The current charging state x_{STTES,t+1} can be calculated using the following equation and the charging state of the previous timestep ( x_{STTES,t} ) as well as the input and output energy x_{STTES,t+1} = x_{STTES,t} + \\frac{Q_{STTES,in,t} - Q_{STTES,out,t}}{Q_{STTES,rated}} leading to the total energy content in every timestep as Q_{STTES,t} = Q_{STTES,rated} \\ x_{STTES,t}.

Due to the long storage period, energy losses to the environment and exergy losses within the storage must be taken into account.

Stratisfied storage model based on [Lago2019] 14 and modified to account for cones according to [Steinacker2022] 15 and for half-burried storages. Three different energy or exergy loss mechanisms are taken into account as shown in the figure above: Energy losses to the environment through the outer walls (bottom, walls and lid) of each storage layer ( \\dot{Q}_{STES,loss} ), characterized by the heat transfer coefficient of the outer surfaces U_{STES,bottom/wall/lid} Exergy losses due to diffusion processes between the storage layers \\dot{Q}_{STES,diffus.} , specified by the diffusion coefficient \\xi_{STES} Exergy losses due to convection (buoyancy) between the storage layers \\dot{Q}_{STES,buoy.} . The temperature T_l in layer l with height \\Delta z_l is given by the partial differential equation \\frac{\\delta T_{STES,l} }{\\delta t} = \\underbrace{\\xi_{STES} \\frac{\\delta^2 T_{STES,l}}{\\delta z^2}}_{\\text{diffusion}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{M_{STES,l} \\ U_{STES,l}}{\\rho_{STES} \\ c_{p,STES} \\ V_{STES,l}} \\left(T_{STES,amb,l} - T_{STES,l}\\right)}_{\\text{energy losses to ambient}} + \\ \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot \\\\ \\ \\\\ \\ \\underbrace{\\frac{\\dot m_{STES} (T_{STES,l,in}-T_{STES,l})}{\\rho_{STES} \\ V_{STES,l}}}_{\\text{direct (un-)loading}} The ambient temperature of each layer T_{amb,l} can be either the ambient air temperature T_{amb,air} in the specific time step or the ground temperature T_{ground} depending on the considered layer l and the number of layer burried under the ground surface. Using the explicite Euler method for integration, the previous equation leads to the temperature in every timestep t and layer l with respect to the temperatures in the timestep bevore and the layers around (without the index _{STES} for better overview) \\begin{aligned} &T_{t+1,l} = T_{t,l} + \\left( \\xi_{STES} \\frac{T_{t,l+1} + T_{t,l-1} - 2 T_{t,l}}{\\Delta z^2_{l,vol}} + \\sigma_l (T_{amb,l} - T_{t,l}) + \\phi_l \\dot{m}_{t,l} \\left(T_{t,l,in} - T_{t,l} \\right) \\right) \\Delta t \\\\ % & \\text{with the volume-related layer height} \\\\ &\\Delta z_{l,vol} = \\Delta z_l \\ \\sqrt{\\frac{n_l \\ V_{STES,l}}{V_{STES}} } \\ \\ \\text{(because \\(\\Delta z_l = const.\\), but \\(V_{STES,l} \\neq const.\\)),} \\\\[5pt] % & \\text{the coefficient of heat losses to the environment} \\\\ &\\sigma_l = \\begin{cases} \\frac{A_{STES,lid} \\ U_{STES,lid} + M_{STES,l} \\ U_{STES,l}}{c_{p,STES} \\ \\rho_{STES} \\ V_{LZSWP,l}} &\\text{for l = lid layer} \\\\[5pt] \\frac{A_{STES,bottom} \\ U_{STES,bottom} + M_{STES,l} \\ U_{STES,l}}{c_{p,STES} \\ \\rho_{STES} \\ V_{LZSWP,l}} &\\text{for l = bottom layer} \\\\[5pt] \\frac{M_{STES,l} \\ U_{STES,l}}{c_{p,STES} \\ \\rho_{STES} \\ V_{LZSWP,l}} &\\text{for l = sandwich layers} \\end{cases} \\\\ % &\\text{and the coefficient for direct loading and unloading} \\\\ &\\phi_l = \\frac{1 }{\\rho_{STES} \\ V_{STES,l}} \\ % \\end{aligned} As the coefficients mentioned above are constant within the simulation time, they can be precomputed for cumputational efficiency. To illustrate the principle of the implemented model, the following figure shows the mass flow into and out of the STES as well as examplary for one transition between two layers the mass flow between the layers within the model. The corresponding temperatures are the temperatures of the source (input flow or layer temperature of the previous layer). As a convention, the lowermost layer is labeled with the number 1. The inflow and outflow is always in the top and bottom layers. For correct results, the inegrated mass flow within one timestep has to be smaller than the volume of the smallest layer element of the storage (ToDo: Maybe fix this issue in Quasi II?) To account for buoyancy effects, a check is made in each time step to determine whether the temperature gradient in the reservoir corresponds to the physically logical state, meaning that the temperatures in the upper layers are higher than in the lower storage layers. If, however, an inverse temperature gradient is present, a mixing process is performed in each time step for all layers, beginning with l=2 : T_l = T_l + \\theta_l \\ \\text{max} (0, T_{l-1} - T_l) \\text{ for } l > 1 \\text{ and }\\\\ T_{l-1} = T_{l-1} - (1-\\theta_l) \\ \\text{max} (0, T_{l-1} - T_l) \\text{ for } l > 1 using the volume-ratio of each layer \\theta_l with respect to the surrounding layers, inspired by [Lago2019] 14 : \\theta_{l} = \\frac{V_{STES,l-1}}{V_{STES,l} + V_{STES,l-1}} \\in [0,1] \\text{ for } l > 1. This method was extensively tested in [Steinacker2022] 15 and compared to calculations performed with TRNSYS Type 142 with high agreement. Is was shown that an optimal number of layers for this model is 25, considering computational efficiency and quality of the results.

The energy balance of the heat pump model is shown in the following figure: The efficiency of the heat pump is defined by the coefficient of performance (COP). The COP determines the electrical power P_{el,HP} required to raise the temperature of a mass flow from the lower temperature level T_{HP,source,in} to T_{HP,sink,out} : COP_{HP} = \\frac{\\dot{Q}_{HP,out}}{P_{el,HP}} \\quad \\leq \\quad COP_{Carnot} = \\frac{T_{HP,sink,out}[K]}{T_{HP,sink,out}-T_{HP,source,in} } COP_{HP} = \\eta_{Carnot} \\ COP_{Carnot} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad 0 \\leq \\eta_{Carnot} \\leq 1 The COP is always smaller than the maximum possible Carnot coefficient of performance ( COP_{Carnot} ), which is calculated from the condenser outlet and evaporator inlet temperature.

Therefore, an empirical model based on manufacturer data or certification process data is implemented in Quasi. There are several aspects to be considered when simulating a heat pump based on equation-fitting, which will be briefly described in the following: The COP of a heat pump, representing the efficiency in a current time step, depends highly on the temperature of the source and the requested temperature of the heat demand. Generally speaking, the efficiency and thus the COP decreases with larger temperature differences between source and sink. Additionaly, the maximum thermal power of the heat pump is not constant for different operation temperatures. The available thermal power is decreasing with lower source temperature, an effect that mainly occurs in heat pumps with air as the source medium. The rated power given for a specific heat pump is only valid for a specified combination of sink and source temperature. The specification for the declaration of the rated power is described in DIN EN 14511 3 . Furthermore, the efficiency and therefor the COP is changing in part load operation. In the past, mostly on-off heat pump where used, regulating the total power output in a given time span by alternating the current state beween on and off. This causes efficency losses mostly due to thermal capacity effects and initial compression power needed at each start. (ToDo: Socal2021) In the last years, modulating heat pumps are more common, using a frequency inverter to adjust the speed of the compression motor and therefor affecting the power output. Interestingly, this method leads to an efficiency increase in part load operation with a peak in efficiency at around 30 to 60 % of the nominal power output. In the literature, many research groups have investigated this effect, compare for excample to Bettanini2003 4 , Toffanin2019 5 , Torregrosa-Jaime2008 6 , Fuentes2019 7 , Blervaque2015 1 or Fahlen2012 8 . For a most realistic representation, all three discussed effects need to be considered - temperature-dependent COP, temperature-dependent power and part-load-dependent COP. The calulation of these dependencies will be described below.","title":"Modelling approaches for HP: Overview"},{"location":"Technische_Beschreibung/#modelling-approaches-for-hp-detail","text":"Temperature-dependent COP The temperature-dependend COP can be calculated from different methods: using the COP_{Carnot} with the carnot effiency factor \\eta_{Carnot} as explained above (easy, simple and fast, but unreal high efficiency with small temperature differences of source and sink) looking up the COP in a look-up table in dependence of the condenser outlet and the evaporator inlet temperature (for computational efficienc, lookup-tables are fitted to polynomes in pre-processing) COP calculated as fraction of temperature-dependend electrical and thermal power, gained from generally developed polynomes. Here, the temperature-depended variation of the maximal power output of the heat pump can be directly taken into account. As example for a lookup-table COP (second bulletpoint above), the following figure from Steinacker2022 15 shows a map of a high-temperature heat pump as a set of curves, depending on the evaporator inlet and condenser outlet temperature. In three dimensions, this figure would result in a surface that can be parameterized with a three-dimensional spline interpolation algorithm. ToDO: translate to english Maximum thermal and electrical power In order to adress a change in maximum power output or input of the heat pump at different operating temperatures, two different approaches can be used. The more complex but also more accurate approache is the use of polynomial fits of temperature-dependend thermal and electrical power. These polynomes depend on the condenser outlet and the evaporator inlet temperature and they need to be calculated from manufacturer data or from measurements. In order to adress the early planning stage, general, market-averaged polynomes need to be created, representing an average heat pump. Aditionally, one specific heat pump model can be used if the the required data is available. ToDo : Add method of calculating market-averaged polynomes! Biquadratic polynomes according to TRNSYS Type 401 \\dot{Q}_{HP,max} = c_{q1} + c_{q2} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,source,in} + c_{q3} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,sink,out} + c_{q4} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,source,in} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,sink,out} + \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot \\\\ \\ c_{q5} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,source,in}^2 + c_{q6} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,sink,out}^2 \\dot{P}_{el,HP,max} = c_{p1} + c_{p2} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,source,in} + c_{p3} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,sink,out} + c_{p4} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,source,in} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,sink,out} + \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot \\\\ \\ c_{p5} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,source,in}^2 + c_{p6} \\ \\bar{T}_{HP,sink,out}^2 where all temeratures have to be normed according to \\bar{T} = \\frac{T \\ [\u00b0C]}{273.15} + 1 The second method to adjust the electrical and thermal energy would be a linear gradient that adjust the rated power in dependency of one temperature. Checking the available data of many different heat pumps from Stiebel-Eltron 9 , a simplified correlation can be observed: the thermal power is dependend on the source temperature, but independent on the sink temperature (the lower the source temperature the lower is the heating power) the electrical power is dependend on the sink temperature, but independent on the source temperature (the higher the sink temperature the higher is the electrical power consumption) This gives the possibility to linearly adjust the available thermal power with the change of the source temperature and the electrical power demand with the change of the temperature of the sink. Which power needs to be adjusted depends on the choice of the control strategy - thermally or electrically controlled. The gradient of the power de- or increase with changing temperature needs to be specified. Part load efficiency The COP of the modeled heat pump depends not only on the temperatures of the sink and the source but also on the current part load ratio (PLR). The relation of the COP and the PLR is assumed to be non-linear. The COP can be corrected using a non-linear part load factor (PLF) in dependence of the PLR. Part load ratio (PLR) = power (el. or th.) demand or availability in current time step in relation to maximum power (el. or th.) with current temperatures: PLR = \\frac{current \\ power}{max. \\ power} Part load facor (PLF) = adjustment factor for COP at different PLR: COP_{part-load} = COP_{full-load} * PLF It follows from the definition of the COP that the correlation between the electrical power consumption and the heat output of the heat pump in part load operation is therefore not linear too. For simplification, the heat output of the heat pump itself is assumed to linear in part load operation between \\dot{Q}_{HP,min} at PL_{HP,min} and \\dot{Q}_{HP,max} at 100% compressor speed as shown in the figure below. The coefficient of performance in partial load operation is approximated using a correction function. The literature provides different examples for the quadratic part-load behaviour of the COP (see section \"Overview\" for literature examples). As an example, the part-load-dependend COP of an ENRGI-Heatpump is shown in the following figure (Source: Enrgi 10 ) The part-load behaviour depends also on the type of the heat pump (on-off or inverter heat pump), as shown for example in Bettanini2003 4 or in Socal2021 11 . For illustration, the following figure is taken from the latter reference to demonstrate the different part load factors of the COP (y-axis) at different part load ratios for different heat pump technologies: Taking the correction factor curve from the figure above for inverter heat pumps, the maximum part load factor is reached at 50 % part load with an increase of the COP of 1.1. Contrary, in Toffanin2019 5 , the part load factor is assumed to be much higher, reaching its maximum at 25 % part load ratio with a part load factor of 2.1. These discrepancies illustrate the wide range of literature data and the difficulty in finding a general part load curve. The figure above shows also the difference of the part load factor comparing on-off and inverter heat pumps as well as the defined on-off losses in DIN EN 14825 for the calculation of the seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP).

The cycling losses of the heat pump in both TRNSYS models are calculated using an exponential function to describe the thermal capacity effecs during heat-up and cool-down. Here, these cycling losses will only be used during start and stop of the heat pump - actual cycling losses from on-off heatpumps will be considered separately in the process to allow the consideration of modulating heat pumps as well. Steps to calculate the electrical and thermal energy in- and outputs of HP: using polynomial fits to calculate stationary thermal and electrical full-load power at given temperatures of T_{HP,sink,out} and T_{HP,source,in} for given nominal thermal power differing source and sink medium: air-water water-water sole-water differing temperature range: normale heat pump high-temperature heat pump polynomial fits have to be normalized to rated power at specified temperatures!

Here, the T_{HP,sink,out} is a fixed, user-specified value in the presented simplified model. The polynomes describing the temperature-depended thermal and electrical power of the heat pump need to be normalized to the power consumption at the rated operation point. Therefore, the following steps are necessary: fit data to polynome for thermal and electrical energy calculate power at specified nominal temperatures with generated fitted polynome normalize polynome to calculated rated power at specific temperature using a fraction_factor If universal data table or the Carnot-COP reduced by an efficiency factor should be used instead of the more accurate model described above, a different calculation approach is needed: Get power at current temperatures using nominal power without a temperature-dependency or using polynomial fits to calculate stationary thermal or electrical full-load power at given temperatures of T_{HP,sink,out} and T_{HP,source,in} , depending on control strategy (see above) get stationary full-load COP at given temperatures of T_{HP,sink,out} and T_{HP,source,in} either from COP data table (fitted to polynome in pre-calculation) or Carnot-COP reduced by an efficiency factor determine the unknown, non-controlled full load power (electrial or thermal) with known, controlled power and COP get demand of controlled energy (thermal or electrical) differing if thermal or electric energy related operation strategy is chosen calculate part load ratio (PLR) with current demand and temperature-dependend full-load power get part load factor (PLF) from coeffcicient curve using the PLR to adjust full-load COP differing: modulating (intverter) or on-off heat pump calculate part-load COP using full-load COP and PLF may adjust part-load COP by icing losses (air-water, air-air) calculate the non-controlled (either electrical or thermal) power with adjusted part-load COP and the controlled power Inputs und Outputs of the Heat Pump: Symbol Description Unit \\dot{Q}_{HP,in} heat flow supplied to the HP (heat source) [MW] \\dot{Q}_{HP,out} heat flow leaving the HP (heat sink) [MW] P_{el,HP} electric power demand of the HP [MW] P_{el,HP,supply} electric power demand of the HP incl. losses of the power electronics [MW] T_{HP,sink,in} condenser inlet temperature [\u00b0C] T_{HP,sink,out} condenser outlet temperature [\u00b0C] T_{HP,source,in} evaporator inlet temperature [\u00b0C] T_{HP,source,out} evaporator outlet temperature [\u00b0C] Parameter of the Heat Pump: ToDO Symbol Description Unit \\dot{Q}_{HP,max} maximum thermal power of the heat pump [MW] \\dot{Q}_{HP,min} minimum thermal power of the heat pump at PL_{HP,min} [MW] PL_{HP,min} minimum possible part load of the heat pump [%] COP_{HP}(T_{HP,sink,out}, T_{HP,source,in}, x_{HP}) coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump incl. thermal losses depending on T_{HP,sink,out} and T_{HP,source,in} and on current state x_{HP} [-] \\eta_{HP,PE} efficiency of power electronics of heat pump [-] \\eta_{Carnot} efficiency factor of heat pump, reduces the Carnot-COP [-] MOT_{HP} minimum operating time of heat pump [min] SUP_{HP} start-up time of the HP until full heat supply (linear curve) [min] State Variables of Heat Pump: Symbol Description Unit x_{HP} current operating state (on, off, part load) [%]","title":"Steps to perform in the simulation model of the heat pump"},{"location":"Technische_Beschreibung/#electrolyser","text":"The electrolyzer uses electrical energy to split water into its components hydrogen ( H_2 ) and oxygen ( O_2 ) as shown in the following reaction equation: 2 \\ H_2O \\rightarrow 2 \\ H_2 + O_2 If the electrical energy is provided by renewable energies, the resulting hydrogen is labeled as \"green hydrogen\" and can be used to decarbonize the mobility or industrial sector or fed into the natural gas grid.

For flexible operation, it is possible to discharge the waste heat to the environment using a chiller. The use of waste heat is an important factor for the overall efficiency of the electrolyzer. The general energy and mass flow in the electrolyser as well as the losses considered in the model can be seen in the following figure.

Three different energy or exergy loss mechanisms are taken into account as shown in the figure above: Energy losses to the environment through the outer walls (bottom, walls and lid) of each storage layer ( \\dot{Q}_{STES,loss} ), characterized by the heat transfer coefficient of the outer surfaces U_{STES,bottom/wall/lid} Exergy losses due to diffusion processes between the storage layers \\dot{Q}_{STES,diffus.} , specified by the diffusion coefficient \\xi_{STES} Exergy losses due to convection (buoyancy) between the storage layers \\dot{Q}_{STES,buoy.} . The temperature T_l in layer l with height \\Delta z_l is given by the partial differential equation \\frac{\\delta T_{STES,l} }{\\delta t} = \\underbrace{\\xi_{STES} \\frac{\\delta^2 T_{STES,l}}{\\delta z^2}}_{\\text{diffusion}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{M_{STES,l} \\ U_{STES,l}}{\\rho_{STES} \\ c_{p,STES} \\ V_{STES,l}} \\left(T_{STES,amb,l} - T_{STES,l}\\right)}_{\\text{energy losses to ambient}} + \\ \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot \\\\ \\ \\\\ \\ \\underbrace{\\frac{\\dot m_{STES} (T_{STES,l,in}-T_{STES,l})}{\\rho_{STES} \\ V_{STES,l}}}_{\\text{direct (un-)loading}} The ambient temperature of each layer T_{amb,l} can be either the ambient air temperature T_{amb,air} in the specific time step or the ground temperature T_{ground} depending on the considered layer l and the number of layer burried under the ground surface. Using the explicite Euler method for integration, the previous equation leads to the temperature in every timestep t and layer l with respect to the temperatures in the timestep bevore and the layers around (without the index _{STES} for better overview) \\begin{aligned} &T_{t+1,l} = T_{t,l} + \\left( \\xi_{STES} \\frac{T_{t,l+1} + T_{t,l-1} - 2 T_{t,l}}{\\Delta z^2_{l,vol}} + \\sigma_l (T_{amb,l} - T_{t,l}) + \\phi_l \\dot{m}_{t,l} \\left(T_{t,l,in} - T_{t,l} \\right) \\right) \\Delta t \\\\ % & \\text{with the volume-related layer height} \\\\ &\\Delta z_{l,vol} = \\Delta z_l \\ \\sqrt{\\frac{n_l \\ V_{STES,l}}{V_{STES}} } \\ \\ \\text{(because \\(\\Delta z_l = const.\\), but \\(V_{STES,l} \\neq const.\\)),} \\\\[5pt] % & \\text{the coefficient of heat losses to the environment} \\\\ &\\sigma_l = \\begin{cases} \\frac{A_{STES,lid} \\ U_{STES,lid} + M_{STES,l} \\ U_{STES,l}}{c_{p,STES} \\ \\rho_{STES} \\ V_{LZSWP,l}} &\\text{for l = lid layer} \\\\[5pt] \\frac{A_{STES,bottom} \\ U_{STES,bottom} + M_{STES,l} \\ U_{STES,l}}{c_{p,STES} \\ \\rho_{STES} \\ V_{LZSWP,l}} &\\text{for l = bottom layer} \\\\[5pt] \\frac{M_{STES,l} \\ U_{STES,l}}{c_{p,STES} \\ \\rho_{STES} \\ V_{LZSWP,l}} &\\text{for l = sandwich layers} \\end{cases} \\\\ % &\\text{and the coefficient for direct loading and unloading} \\\\ &\\phi_l = \\frac{1 }{\\rho_{STES} \\ V_{STES,l}} \\ % \\end{aligned} As the coefficients mentioned above are constant within the simulation time, they can be precomputed for cumputational efficiency. To illustrate the principle of the implemented model, the following figure shows the mass flow into and out of the STES as well as examplary for one transition between two layers the mass flow between the layers within the model. The corresponding temperatures are the temperatures of the source (input flow or layer temperature of the previous layer). As a convention, the lowermost layer is labeled with the number 1. The inflow and outflow is always in the top and bottom layers. For correct results, the inegrated mass flow within one timestep has to be smaller than the volume of the smallest layer element of the storage (ToDo: Maybe fix this issue in Quasi II?) To account for buoyancy effects, a check is made in each time step to determine whether the temperature gradient in the reservoir corresponds to the physically logical state, meaning that the temperatures in the upper layers are higher than in the lower storage layers. If, however, an inverse temperature gradient is present, a mixing process is performed in each time step for all layers, beginning with l=2 : T_l = T_l + \\theta_l \\ \\text{max} (0, T_{l-1} - T_l) \\text{ for } l > 1 \\text{ and }\\\\ T_{l-1} = T_{l-1} - (1-\\theta_l) \\ \\text{max} (0, T_{l-1} - T_l) \\text{ for } l > 1 using the volume-ratio of each layer \\theta_l with respect to the surrounding layers, inspired by [Lago2019] 14 : \\theta_{l} = \\frac{V_{STES,l-1}}{V_{STES,l} + V_{STES,l-1}} \\in [0,1] \\text{ for } l > 1. This method was extensively tested in [Steinacker2022] 15 and compared to calculations performed with TRNSYS Type 142 with high agreement. Is was shown that an optimal number of layers for this model is 25, considering computational efficiency and quality of the results.
